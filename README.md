# ProseMirror Mentions

A [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net/) plugin that enables @mentions and #hashtags in a prosemirror view.

Alternative: [https://github.com/quartzy/prosemirror-suggestions](https://github.com/quartzy/prosemirror-suggestions)

While prosemirror-suggestions is a lighter weight plugin, that holds no opinions on the UI, prosemirror-mentions eases out the implementation. It comes with all batteries included: default dropdown UI, behaviour handling, support for async fetching of suggestions, etc. making it easier to enable @mentions and #hashtags by customizing the default configuration.

## Installation

npm install prosemirror-mentions
```
